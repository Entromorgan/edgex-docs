## Introduction

The EdgeX System Management Agent (SMA) exposes the EdgeX management
service API to 3rd party systems. In other words, the Agent serves as a
proxy for system management service API calls into each micro service.
In the future, the SMA may also offer the management API in other remote
management/control system protocols like LWM2M, OMA DM, etc.
